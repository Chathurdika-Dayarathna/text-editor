# Text Editor App

This is a Java-based text editor application with various features to enhance your editing experience. The app is built using JavaFX for the graphical user interface and JavaSE for file input/output operations.

## Features

1. **Edit**: The app provides a user-friendly interface to edit text files with basic editing capabilities such as typing, deleting, copying, and pasting.

2. **Save**: You can save your edited file with the desired name and location on your computer. The app utilizes JavaSE's file input/output operations to handle file saving.

3. **Open**: You can open existing text files from your computer and load their contents into the editor for further editing.

4. **Drag and Drop**: The app supports drag and drop functionality, allowing you to easily open text files by dragging them from your file explorer and dropping them onto the editor.

5. **Find**: You can search for specific words or phrases within the text using the find feature. The app will locate the first occurrence of the search term and highlight it in the editor.

6. **Find All**: This feature enables you to find and highlight all occurrences of a given search term within the text. It provides an overview of all matches found, allowing you to navigate through them easily.

7. **Replace**: You can replace individual occurrences of a search term with a desired replacement. This feature helps you modify the text content efficiently.

8. **Replace All**: If you want to replace all occurrences of a search term in the text, this feature will perform a bulk replacement, saving you time and effort.

9. **Match Case or Ignore Case**: When performing search or replace operations, you have the option to match the case sensitivity of the search term or ignore it, depending on your needs.

10. **Matching Words Highlighting**: As you type a search term, the app dynamically highlights the matching words within the text, providing instant feedback and making it easier to identify relevant content.
